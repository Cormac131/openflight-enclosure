# Printable parts

Each part has its own version folder so you can keep a release set and experiments side by side.

| Folder | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `v1/` | Current release — print these |
| `experimental/` | In-progress or test prints — do not use for a production unit unless you mean to |
| `eol/` | Withdrawn variants kept for archive only |

Mix versions only on purpose (for example a `v1` shell with an experimental radar).
